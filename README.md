Diabetic Retinopathy Detection System
This project is a comprehensive solution for detecting diabetic retinopathy using deep learning techniques. Diabetic retinopathy is a medical condition that affects the eyes, and early detection is crucial for preventing severe complications. This system leverages a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to analyze retinal images and classify them based on the severity of diabetic retinopathy.

Key Features:
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a CNN trained on a large dataset of retinal images to accurately detect and classify diabetic retinopathy.
Streamlit Web Application: A user-friendly web interface built with Streamlit that allows users to upload retinal images and receive instant diagnostic feedback.
Image Preprocessing: Implements image preprocessing techniques to enhance the quality of the input images, improving the model's accuracy.
Real-time Results: Provides quick and reliable predictions, making it a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in screening and early diagnosis.
Scalable and Extendable: The project is designed to be scalable, allowing for the integration of additional features such as segmentation and multi-class classification.

Technology Stack:
Python: The core language used for developing the model and the web application.
TensorFlow/Keras: Used for building and training the CNN model.
OpenCV: Employed for image preprocessing tasks.
Streamlit: For creating the interactive web interface.

How to Use:
Clone the repository.
Install the required dependencies.
Run the Streamlit application using the command: streamlit run app.py.
Upload a retinal image to the web interface and get the prediction.

Future Enhancements:
Model Improvement: Continue training with more diverse datasets to improve accuracy.
Advanced Segmentation: Integrate segmentation models for more detailed analysis of retinal images.
Multi-Class Classification: Extend the model to classify images into multiple stages of diabetic retinopathy.
